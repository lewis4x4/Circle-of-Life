## Summary

One sentence describing the bug. Also acts as the "deck" in the HTML
report — set in serif, sits below the title.

---

## Impact

What does a user experience if this ships unfixed? One or two
sentences. Concrete, user-facing language ("anyone who…", "users
who…"). This is what an engineer scans first when triaging — it
answers "do we care?" before "how do we fix?".

Examples:
- "Anyone who briefly considered an invite from a co-worker can be
  silently joined to that group days later, without their consent
  or knowledge."
- "Users on slow connections see a 'saved' toast but their changes
  are silently dropped; they think the data is safe."
- "Cosmetic — the modal close button is 36×36 on iPhone where the
  HIG minimum is 44×44. Users with gloves or accessibility needs
  may miss it."

## Risk to fix

*(Usually empty at file time; populated by the engineer during the
BRB. Leave blank if QA can't reasonably assess.)*

Engineer's marginal note: how scary is fixing this? One or two
sentences covering the blast radius, the touched surfaces, and any
known coupling. Helps the BRB decide "fix now or defer".

Examples:
- "Local — the invite-resolution code path is a single function in
  `convex/invites.ts`. Low blast radius; covered by integration
  tests."
- "Cross-cutting — touches the auth provider's session handling,
  the router, and the storage abstraction. Needs a coordinated
  change."
- "Unknown — the responsible code was written before our current
  test coverage. Recommend a spike before scheduling."
