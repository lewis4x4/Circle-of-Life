# Track D — Phase 6 completion pass (execution log)

**Purpose:** Record **which Phase 6 module** is in focus for each bounded segment and what shipped. Authoritative module specs remain in `12-*` … `23-*`; [README.md](./README.md) § Track D lists example Enhanced gaps.

**First target (D1):** **Module 15 — Transportation** ([15-transportation.md](./15-transportation.md)).

**Rationale:** COL runs real resident transport and mileage workflows; the admin hub had **placeholder** “compliance” cards. **D1 slice:** replace mocks with **data-driven** expiry reminders from `driver_credentials` (license, medical card) and `fleet_vehicles` (insurance, registration) for the selected facility — operational visibility without new DDL.

**Deferred in D1 (still Track D backlog):** resident transport request scheduling UI, trip calendar, HL7 (Module 22), reputation sync (Module 23), training certificate uploads (Module 12), dietary cross-checks (Module 14).

**Gate artifact:** `test-results/agent-gates/2026-04-09T00-02-57-723Z-track-d-phase6-d1-transportation.json` (`npm run segment:gates -- --segment "track-d-phase6-d1-transportation" --ui --no-chaos`).

**Mission alignment:** **pass** — surfaces real compliance dates already governed by RLS; supports safer transport operations.
